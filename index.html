    <h1>Assignment - Pyber</h1>
    <p>
        For this assignment we organized our rider and city data for Pyber to calculate 
        counts, averages, and sums of Drivers, Fares, and Rides given in a city, whether it be Rural, 
        Urban, or Suburban, to make meaningful plots to visualize the differences in the use of Pyber 
        in those cities.
